### Qubitro MQTT Examples - Javascript

Javascript MQTT documentation for [Qubitro](www.qubitro.com) IoT (Internet of Things) platform in sync with [Qubitro Documentation](docs.qubitro.com)

Examples are built with [MQTT.js](https://github.com/mqttjs)

The MQTT protocol is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. Designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport, it is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.
